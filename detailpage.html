                        Fallow was founded by three individuals in May 2019, two
                        chefs Jack Croft and William Murray, and career
                        hospitality entrepreneur James Robson. The essence of
                        this combination makes up much of Fallows DNA, where
                        conscious culinary creativity meets hospitality
                        experience and passion. What followed from this meeting
                        were a series of sold-out residencies to establish
                        Fallow as one of the most exciting restaurant concepts
                        on the UK restaurant scene. Fallow’s permanent home in
                        St James’s market was established in November 2021 and
                        has since attracted a string of awards including both
                        the Marie Claire and GQ ‘sustainable restaurant of the
                        year’ and the Caterer award for ‘best new restaurant’.
